# nobleNoteAndroid

nobleNote for Android is a simple note taking app. 

Notes can be put into notebooks and notes are saved as html files on the sd card or the internal storage. 
It is compatible to the [nobleNote](https://github.com/hakaishi/nobleNote) desktop application for Linux, Windows and macOS.
The integrated text editor offers some limited rich text formatting options when text is selected. The nobleNote desktop application offers a full fledged rich text editor. 

It requires at least Android 5.1 to run. The recommended minimum version is Android 7.

## Sync notes between desktop and mobile devices

1.) Install [nobleNote](https://github.com/hakaishi/nobleNote) on your Linux/Windows/macOS device and find the folder containing the nobleNote notebooks. 

2.) In nobleNoteAndroid, select a folder on the external storage (sd-card) using the settings.

3.) Use a sync software of your choice (e.g. [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net), Dropbox) to sync the folder containining the notebooks with the same folder on your Linux/Windows/macOS device. nobleNote will detect when notes have been changed on the file system and reload them automatically.
